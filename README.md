## Supported Algorithms & Modes

| Algorithm | Key Size | Supported Modes | Multithreading Support |
|-----------|----------|----------------|-----------------------|
| AES-128   | 128-bit  | CBC, CFB, OFB, ECB, GCM, CTR | ECB, CTR, OFB, GCM |
| AES-192   | 192-bit  | CBC, CFB, OFB, ECB, GCM, CTR | ECB, CTR, OFB, GCM |
| AES-256   | 256-bit  | CBC, CFB, OFB, ECB, GCM, CTR | ECB, CTR, OFB, GCM |
| DES       | 56-bit   | CBC, CFB, OFB, ECB | ECB, OFB |
| 3DES      | 168-bit  | CBC, CFB, OFB, ECB | ECB, OFB |
| Blowfish  | 128-bit  | CBC, CFB, OFB, ECB | ECB, OFB |
| Twofish   | 256-bit  | CBC, CFB, OFB, ECB | ECB, OFB |
| RC4       | 128-bit  | Stream | Single-threaded only |
| ChaCha20  | 256-bit  | Stream | Single-threaded only |
| Camellia  | 128/192/256-bit | CBC, CFB, OFB, ECB | ECB, OFB |

### Multithreading Notes
- **Parallelizable modes**: ECB, CTR, OFB, GCM can utilize multiple CPU cores
- **Sequential modes**: CBC, CFB require single-threaded processing due to block dependencies
- **Stream ciphers**: RC4, ChaCha20 are inherently sequential
- **Thread count**: User-adjustable from 1 to 2x CPU core count (max 16 threads)
- **Minimum chunk size**: 64KB per thread for effective parallelization
